- There are three basic steps: While you are editing, keep an eye out for actions you repeat and/or spend quite a bit of time on. Find out if there is an editor command that will do this action quicker. Read the documentation, ask a friend, or look at how others do this. Train using the command. Do this until your fingers type it without thinking
- "I want to get the work done, I don't have time to look through the documentation to find some new command". If you think like this, you will get stuck in the stone age of computing.
