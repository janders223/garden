### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- The Mind is a computational structure which results from the mixture of Genes, Cultures and Consciousness. While these three interact in complex ways, they are ultimately computational systems on their own which appeared at different stages of history and which follow their own selective processes operating at different time scales.

- John Von Neumann (1903-1957), a genius who designed and engineered the architecture of most of our present computers, he was also part of the Manhattan Project, originated the field of economics called Game Theory, and had many contributions to theoretical mathematics, statistics, quantum mechanics, and others.

- Herbert Simon (1916-2001), the only person to have obtained both the Nobel Prize and the Turing Award. He is recognized as one of the founders of both Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence, and made important contributions to Cognitive Science, Public Administration, Economics, Management and Computer Science.

- The liberal institutions created in the foundation of the United States were carefully designed, not to protect the masses from the elites, but the elites from the masses. “The tyranny of the legislatures is the most formidable dread at present, and will be for long years.” [Jefferson, 1789].
