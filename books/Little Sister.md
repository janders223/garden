- To doubt is to bare your belly to the sword of your enemy. ([Location 2411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0157ZIUZE&location=2411))
- ‘No – and nor were the clever liberals I knew at Cambridge. But still, your children grow fat, while ours are too weak to brush the crust from their eyelids. You send your rock stars to weep over their graves, while your leaders consort with the financiers who ensure that food is kept from their mouths. You lecture us about democracy, while propping up any tyrant who promises to supply your oil. Everyone says they are not to blame. All I know is that the power to change things lies in the hands of the rich – who have no interest in change, and indeed a great fear of it.’ ([Location 4933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0157ZIUZE&location=4933))
