### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- I reread the source text (to validate I was honestly translating my literature notes), my fleeting notes, and my literature notes, and then I thought about why I care about that passage at all. Why did I notate it?  Where does it fit in my worldview?  What does it support or contradict?  What ideas does it flesh out?  Or is it a new idea altogether that offers a new branch in the ever growing forest of my consciousness?
- I had 4 colors of stickies that I used: Green = meaningful concept that I agree with and want to convert into a literature note Purple = awesome quote that I want to lift verbatim and hold on to Pink = disagree with this idea Orange = primary source I want to flag to review myself later
