- Inline elements will squeeze next to each other on one line (and wrap if they have to, just like words in a sentence).
- Block elements, on the other hand, like to stand alone. In terms of printed console output, you could think of a block element as having a 
  newline before and after it.
- An inline element wonâ€™t prevent block elements inside it from breaking the line.
