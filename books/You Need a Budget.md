### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- In truth, when we’re stressed about our finances, it’s because we’re not sure our money decisions are aligned with the life we want to be living. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=209))

- The question we need to ask ourselves isn’t Can I? or Should I? It’s What do I want my money to do for me? ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=211))
- What do I want my money to do for me? is about nothing less than deciding what kind of life you want to live, and then making a plan so your money can help you get there. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=222))

- I mentioned earlier that many of us struggle with money choices because we don’t have a system for making decisions. Your budget is that system. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=239))
- That’s the beauty of a (good) budget: it lets you see exactly how your spending affects the rest of your life. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=242))
- If guilt haunts you it’s usually because: 1.    You know in your gut that a bigger priority needs more of your attention; or 2.    You’re letting other people’s expectations of how you should live your life color your choices.

- Forget future money; use today’s money to write your future. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y2XSFN&location=556))

- Question everything. Once a year (I like to do this in January), question every one of your expenses. Question the “givens” like housing, transportation, and insurance. Question the vacations you always take, the gifts you always buy, and the food you always eat. Every single item should be on the table. Following the tactic of asking why six or seven times as it relates to any one of your line items will help you peel back the layers of that priority and really see it for what it is.
