### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea. For millions of years, human beings have been part of one tribe or another. A group needs only two things to be a tribe: a shared interest and a way to communicate. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0LAI&location=132))
    - **Note:** Ingage this my tribe. We are all one people connected by the idea of a better world driven by Michael and Kelly. 
      By this definition of a tribe I should also feel as though I am a part of a tribe on my team at Kroger and at the gym. However I do not. Does this mean the definition is flawed or my understanding of it?
- Leadership, on the other hand, is about creating change that you believe in. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0LAI&location=259))
    - **Note:** What change do I believe in? Besides a better world and the B corp better. Real change. Developer tooling and making that life better has always been a passion. Is that the change I should lead.
