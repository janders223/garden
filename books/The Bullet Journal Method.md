### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- Intentionality is the power of the mind to direct itself toward that which it finds meaningful and take action toward that end. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=353))
- If intentionality means acting according to your beliefs, then the opposite would be operating on autopilot. In other words, do you know why you’re doing what you’re doing? ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=355))
- We can’t be true to ourselves if we don’t know what we want, and more importantly why, so that’s where we must begin. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=357))
- Leading an intentional life is about keeping your actions aligned with your beliefs. It’s about penning a story that you believe in and that you can be proud of. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=398))
- In an interview published in Vanity Fair, President Barack Obama said, “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.”10 The same is true of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg with his gray hoodies, or Apple founder Steve Jobs and his famous black-turtleneck-and-jeans uniform. Acutely aware of how taxing deliberating over options can be, they sought every opportunity to limit choice in their lives.

- We need to reduce the number of decisions we burden ourselves with so we can focus on what matters. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=441))
- The first step to recovering from decision fatigue, to get out from under the pile of choices weighing on you, is to get some distance from them. You need some perspective to both clearly identify and corral your choices. We do this by writing them down. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=442))
- Holding on to thoughts is like trying to catch fish with your bare hands: They easily slip from your grasp and disappear back into the muddy depths of your mind. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=445))
- Our notebook serves as a mental sanctuary where we are free to think, reflect, process, and focus. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=520))
- Your notebook greets you each morning with the pure, blank slate of an empty page. It serves as a small reminder that the day is as yet unwritten. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=539))
- A University of Washington study demonstrated that elementary school students who wrote essays by hand were far more likely to write in fully formed sentences and learn how to read faster. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=560))
- Often all it takes to live intentionally is to pause before you proceed. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=722))
- If each Bullet Journal is another volume in the story of your life, then the Monthly Log marks a new chapter. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=1094))
- To dare in life is to make yourself vulnerable to the possibility of failure. Most of us don’t welcome failure. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07B7C4F9C&location=1497))
