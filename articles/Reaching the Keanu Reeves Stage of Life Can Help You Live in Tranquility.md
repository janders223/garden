### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- It’s tempting to scream back at a screamer. But when you do, you move further away from the quiet life in the woods that billionaires pay a fortune for.
- Listening is a prerequisite for a discussion. If you can’t get agreement on that, it’s not worth talking. You’re better off staying the quiet one.

- They believe they are right based on their own experience, and to question them is an act of war. So, I simply mute their voice and move on to more open-minded voices.
- Open-mindedness is sexiness — not because it makes your biceps appear bigger — but because open-mindedness is the gateway to understanding the world we live in.
- Crazy thoughts only sound off if you’re not willing to be open-minded to consider what they might be trying to tell you.
- The people you encounter in life, who think they have all the answers, often know very little. The best wisdom can come from quiet observers who see the world rather than speak a lot to force what they see into reality.

- The smartest leaders I’ve ever met don’t speak a lot.
- Tranquility of the mind occurs when the ratio between listening and speaking favors listening.
- Rage mode is difficult to turn on when you don’t speak.
- Speaking doesn’t matter as much when the enormity of death faces you head-on.
- There’s a new pandemic: becoming over-opinionated. Why do you need an opinion?
- “Even if you say 1+1=5, you’re right,” is a perfect example of that. It’s not ignorance. It’s using peace as a quiet protest.
- Too much talking is a weapon of mass destruction in a culture addicted to outrage, trending tweets and salacious headlines.
- What if being happier just meant reacting less to people who aren’t listening or refuse to be open-minded? Maybe Keanu has discovered the secret to life: saying nothing at all.
