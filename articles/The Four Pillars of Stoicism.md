### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.
- Practice saying to every harsh appearance: You are an appearance, and in no manner what you appear to be.
- True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing.
