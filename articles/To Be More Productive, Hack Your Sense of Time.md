- One 2012 study found that when you’re in a state of “approach motivation” — that is, actively pursuing a goal — your mind forms a protective buffer against distractions. Time passes more quickly in these scenarios, the researchers hypothesized, to keep you focused.
- Psychologist Claudia Hammond, author of Time Warped: Unlocking the Mysteries of Time Perception, points to a common cognitive bias known as the planning fallacy, or the tendency to underestimate how long something in the future will take.
- When you’re doing something new or creative — which involves your brain processing more information than normal — you feel like you spent more time on it than you actually did, a phenomenon scientists have dubbed the oddball effect.
