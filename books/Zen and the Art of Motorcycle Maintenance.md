### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=128))
- The truth knocks on the door and you say, “Go away, I’m looking for the truth,” and so it goes away. Puzzling. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=150))
- Unless you’re fond of hollering you don’t make great conversations on a running cycle. Instead you spend your time being aware of things and meditating on them. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=175))
- You always suppress momentary anger at something you deeply and permanently hate. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=314))
- The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha—which is to demean oneself. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=354))
- I argued that physical discomfort is important only when the mood is wrong. Then you fasten on to whatever thing is uncomfortable and call that the cause. But if the mood is right, then physical discomfort doesn’t mean much. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026772N8&location=377))
