### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- So, not only does the modality seem to not matter, but the therapist’s credentials don’t even seem to matter that much either.
- What’s important is simply getting a person in a room regularly to talk about their problems to another human being who is thoughtful and listens well. That’s the 1% that drives 99% of the results.
- It wasn’t until the 1960s and 70s that psychologists considered the idea that journaling may offer therapeutic benefits.
- The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that consciousness consists of two parts: the subject and the object. Think of the subject as “the seer” and the object as “the seen.” Both aspects are required in consciousness — there is always something being “seen” and always something doing the “seeing.”
- It’s only when we turn our focus on ourselves and make our thoughts and feelings the object of our consciousness that we are able to differentiate them and put them into perspective.
- convert what is usually the subject of our consciousness into the object of our consciousness.
- This is how to get better. To turn the subject into object. To transmute the implicit into the explicit. To shift the internal into external. To move from subjective to objective.
