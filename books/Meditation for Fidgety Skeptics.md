- The default mental condition for too many human beings is dissatisfaction. Under the sway of the ego, nothing is good enough. We’re always on the hunt for the next dopamine hit. We hurl ourselves headlong from one cookie, one promotion, one party to the next, and yet a great many of us are never fully sated. How many meals, movies, and vacations have you enjoyed? And are you done yet? Of course not. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y58KF6P&location=154))
- Studies show the more you meditate, the better you are at activating the regions of the brain associated with attention and deactivating the regions associated with mind-wandering. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y58KF6P&location=188))
    - **Note:** Meditation as a flow trigger! I seem to recall reading this in another book before
- Mindfulness is the ability to see what’s happening in your head at any given moment, so that you don’t get carried away by it. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06Y58KF6P&location=195))
