### Highlights from July 26, 2021

- Since this concept may be new for many readers, I want to emphasize that the most important ingredient for making good bread is plenty of time. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=497))
    - **Note:** Do not rush bakes.
- Temperature and time have an inverse relationship, and I like the visual image of a seesaw to communicate the need for balance between the two: more of one means you need less of the other. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=510))
- Extending the bulk fermentation stage is critical to maximum flavor development. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=517))
- For all of my breads, I’ve achieved the best flavor when the freshly mixed dough has a temperature between 75ºF and 80ºF (24ºC and 27ºC). ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=556))
- The autolyse allows the flour to more completely absorb the water and also activates enzymes in the flour; for example, amylase enzymes break down the complex carbohydrates in the flour into simple sugars the yeast can feed on, and protease enzymes naturally degrade the gluten forming proteins, in a way that makes the dough more extensible. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=666))
- Once the final dough is mixed, treat it gently. Being gentle with the dough will help preserve its gluten structure and retain its gas. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=752))
- My rule of thumb is to predissolve the yeast if the dough has 70 percent or less hydration. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007SGLZH6&location=1041))
